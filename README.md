# Listen To This

Playing [/r/listentothis](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis) music on your terminal.

You'll need mpv, youtube-dl and ag.

Currently it is only allowing to reproduce YouTube clips and is only scrapping the front page. I intend to add SoundCloud and pagination, as well to search the daily, weekly, monthly, etc. top tracks.

I haven't set up keystroke forwarding yet, so mpv shortcuts are not available.

You can filter through tags with the `-t` option, but it is only allowing one tag, yet. That'll change in the near future.
